# Hello_World
##This is Runhua Lei. I have been worked for Omaha Zoo for about 13 years.  A few years, I started to challenge myselfe and took some class at UNO. I got so excited about database management and data analytics.  Then,  I entered the graducate school majored in Managemet Information System concentrated on Database management along with certificate of data analytics. This June, I got opportunities to be year-round intern at Decision Analytics Group of Union Pacific. That's a wonderful chance for me to combined what I learned from UNO and the projects in industry at Union Pacific. I plan to graduate next Fall.
